# You can enable/disable it in the Prefs (Admin > Preferences > Advanced).

# Initiate completion by hitting TAB (or Cmd+E).
# Try typing this: @div#page>div.logo+ul#navigation>li*5>a@ and then TAB.
# Works with opening and closing Textpattern tags (try typing @txp:if_section@ and then TAB).
# CSS shortcuts work even better with Emmet* - try typing m and then TAB in Styles.
