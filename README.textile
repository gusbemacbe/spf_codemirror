h2. Installation

# "DOWNLOAD":https://github.com/spiffin/spf_codemirror/zipball/master and unzip;
# Upload the containing 'codemirror' directory to your web root:
** *codemirror*
** css.php
** files
** images
** index.php
** rpc
** sites
** textpattern
# Install and activate the plugin (spf_codemirror.txt - inside the unzipped folder).
# NOTE: the folder structure mirrors that of a standard CodeMirror download (just the 'lib', 'mode' and 'theme' directories) with the addition of the minified emmet.min.js file from Emmet-CodeMirror2 - for easy upgrade.

<hr />

h2. CodeMirror/Emmet upgrade

# You can now easily upgrade CodeMirror (2.35 as of Nov 2012).
# "Download the latest release":http://codemirror.net/codemirror.zip.
# Unzip the download and upload the containing 'lib', 'mode' and 'theme' directories to the codemirror directory on your web server.
# To upgrade Emmet (Zen Coding) "download Emmet-CodeMirror2":https://github.com/emmetio/emmet/downloads, unzip it and upload the containing 'emmet.min.js' file to your codemirror directory.

<hr />

h2. Minify support

# If you have "Minify":http://code.google.com/p/minify/ on your web server in the standard DOCUMENT_ROOT/min location, spf_codemirror will use it to minify css & js - if you don't, it won't.

<hr />

h2. Emmet notes

# Initiate completion by hitting TAB (or Cmd+E).
# Try typing this: @div#page>div.logo+ul#navigation>li*5>a@ and then TAB.
# Works with opening and closing txp tags (try typing @txp:if_section@ and then TAB).
# CSS shortcuts work even better with Emmet* - try typing m and then TAB in Styles.
# "Emmet documentation":http://docs.emmet.io.
*Emmet is the new name for Zen Coding.
