h2. Background

p. This is a quick update to Dale Chapman's "mrd_codeMirror":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=38015 which, in turn, was prompted by my "CodeMirror admin theme":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=37957 and, of course, Marijn Haverbeke's "CodeMirror":http://codemirror.net. Now with "Zen Coding":http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding goodness thrown in.

p. Thanks to Marijn, Sergey and Dale.


h2. Features

# Adds "CodeMirror":http://codemirror.net syntax-highlighting to textareas in Textpattern's Forms, Pages and Style tabs;
# Also to JavaScript tab ("spf_js":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=37849 required) and External Files tab ("spf_ext":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=38032 required);
# Theme selector.
# HTML shorthand/code-completion now added to Pages & Forms courtesy of "Zen Coding":http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding.


h2. Installation

# "DOWNLOAD":https://github.com/spiffin/spf_codemirror/zipball/master and unzip;
# Upload the containing 'codemirror' directory to your web root;
# Install and activate the plugin (spf_codemirror_v0.1.txt - inside the unzipped folder).

h2. Zen Coding notes:

# Initiate completion by hitting TAB (or Cmd+E).
# Try typing this: @div#page>div.logo+ul#navigation>li*5>a@ and then TAB.
# Works with opening and closing txp tags (try typing @txp:if_section@ and then TAB).


h2. Notes & issues

# Included .js and .css files have been combined and minified (original filenames are referenced in header);
# Remora drop-down menus are still hidden behind the textarea;
# Textarea resizing is disabled (enabling gives erratic results);
# Plugins editor not supported;
# Code-folding requires input to the Javascript (which lines to fold) and is therefore disabled;
# Theme selector is bottom-right: not the most elegant solution but works consistently across most admin themes (specifically Classic, Hive, Steel).
# Zen Coding is only available for HTML (Pages & Forms).
